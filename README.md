## Issues and System Compatibility
This module is built for the Pathfinder 2e system, which receives regular updates, and some of those updates may occassionally break the functionality of this module. I will do my best to fix issues caused by updates, but this may require losing support for earlier versions of the system.

Also, some parts of this module may require features/functions from the latest release of the Pathfinder 2e system.

In summary, each release of this module only officially supports the latest release of the Pathfinder 2e system at the time of release, which will be listed in the [Changelog](/CHANGELOG.md). If you encounter an issue, please make sure you're using the latest system version. If the issue persists on the most recent version, please [report it](https://github.com/JDCalvert/FVTT-PF2e-Ranged-Combat/issues/new)!

## Features

### Reloading System
When you have a reloadable weapon (e.g. reload 1 or higher), you can use the <b>Reload</b> macro to reload your weapon, and give yourself the <b>Loaded</b> effect showing that the weapon is loaded. If you have the feats, this also applies the effects of <b>Crossbow Ace</b> and <b>Crossbow Crack Shot</b>. Firing the weapon removes the <b>Loaded</b> effect.

You can also use the <b>Reload NPCs</b> macro to reload all NPCs on the scene. This will reload all the NPCs' weapons (if required) as long as no further input is required, such as selecting ammunition.

If <b>Prevent Firing Weapon if not Loaded</b> is enabled <i>(default: true)</i> in the module settings, then you <i>must</i> reload weapons before you can fire them.

#### Capacity and Double Barrel <small>(e.g. [Pepperbox](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=205) and [Double-Barreled Musket](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=198))</small>
Weapons with the capacity or double barrel trait can be loaded and fired much like other reloadable weapons, but they can be loaded with more than one round, up to their capacity (2 for double barrel).

If <b>Prevent Firing Weapon if not Loaded</b> is enabled, then you must also have the <b>Chamber Loaded</b> effect to fire a capacity weapon. You can use either the <b>Next Chamber</b> macro to switch to a loaded chamber (if the weapon is already loaded with at least one round) or the <b>Reload</b> macro to load a new round. You can fire a double barrel weapon as long as at least one barrel is loaded.

#### Effects
The <b>Loaded</b> effect targets a specific weapon and serves as a reminder that the weapon is loaded. This effect is removed if the weapon is fired and, optionally, the weapon cannot be fired if it isn't loaded.

The <b>Crossbow Ace</b> and <b>Crossbow Crack Shot</b> effects apply the feat effects and can be applied to a particular crossbow.
<small>
- <b>Note:</b> You do not need to use the "Reloaded crossbow or Hunted Prey" toggle when using these effects.

### Advanced Ammunition System
This advanced version of the reloading system handles ammunition management for reloadable and repeating weapons. A Game Master can enable this in the module settings <i>(default: disabled)</i>. This feature is currently implemented only for PCs.

With the Advanced Ammunition System, there are a few changes that affect all weapons that use ammunition:
 - You <i>must</i> have selected ammunition to use the weapon.
 - When the last piece of ammunition in a stack is consumed, the quantity of the stack is reduced to 0 instead of being deleted.

How the rest of the system works depends on the type of weapon:

#### Reload 0 <small>(e.g. [Longbow](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=76))</small>
You don't need to do anything to prepare to fire the weapon. The selected ammunition is consumed when you make the attack roll.

#### Reload 1+ <small>(e.g. [Crossbow](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=67))</small>
You must reload the weapon using the <b>Reload</b> macro before you can fire. The selected ammunition is consumed when you reload the weapon, and the <b>Loaded</b> effect will specify what ammunition is loaded.

If you change the weapon's selected ammunition and use the <b>Reload</b> macro again, the loaded ammunition will be put back in your inventory and the new ammunition loaded.

You can also use the <b>Unload</b> macro to remove the loaded ammunition from the weapon and put it back in your inventory.

#### Repeating <small>(e.g. [Repeating Crossbow](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=176))</small>
Repeating weapons work similarly to reloadable weapons, except you use the <b>Reload Magazine</b> to load a magazine, creating the <b>Magazine Loaded</b> effect.

The <b>Magazine Loaded</b> effect works similarly to the <b>Loaded</b> effect, except the effect also tracks the number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Ammunition is consumed from the magazine when you fire the weapon. When the magazine is empty, it remains loaded (representing the need to remove the existing magazine before replacing it with a new one) but you cannot fire the weapon while the magazine is empty.

You can also use the <b>Reload Magazine</b> macro while a magazine is already loaded:
- If you've changed the weapon's selected ammunition, the new magazine will be loaded. If the current magazine had any remaining ammunition, it is put back in your inventory.
- If the weapon's selected ammunition is the same as the loaded magazine, it will only be swapped if reloading will change the remaining ammunition in the magazine.

You can use the <b>Unload</b> macro to just remove the loaded magazine and, if it still has ammunition remaining, put it back in your inventory.

When a magazine with remaining (but not full) ammunition is removed from a weapon, it creates a new item in your inventory with one magazine with that amount of ammunition remaining. This can create a number of separate items all for the same type of ammunition. You can use the <b>Consolidate Repeating Weapon Ammunition</b> macro to tidy your inventory. This gathers up all the repeating ammunition of each type you have and creates as many full magazines as possible in one stack, and one extra magazine (in a separate stack) with any remaining ammunition left over.

#### Repeating and Reload 1+ <small>(e.g. [Repeating Heavy Crossbow](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=178))</small>
Repeating weapons that still require reloading work almost identically to other repeating weapons, with the extra step that you must use the <b>Reload</b> macro before firing each shot. The ammunition is still only consumed when you fire the weapon. Using the <b>Unload</b> macro will also remove the <b>Loaded</b> effect.

### Hunt Prey
The <b>Hunt Prey</b> macro applies the <b>Hunted Prey</b> effect to your character, with the name of your current target, as a reminder of who your hunted prey is. It also applies the <b>Crossbow Ace</b> effect for your equipped crossbow(s) if you have the feat.

When you target tokens, the Target is your Hunted Prey box will automatically tick or untick based on whether or not you target your hunted prey.

### Link Companion
The <b>Link Companion</b> macro gives a feat to the targeted creature to allow it to make use of your Hunt Prey and Hunter's Edge benefits.

### Alchemical Crossbow
You can use the <b>Load Alchemical Crossbow</b> macro to load a lesser alchemical bomb into an Alchemical Crossbow. This will give your weapon the <b>Loaded Bomb</b> effect, granting an additional 1d6 damage (type depending on the loaded bomb) for the next three shots. As per the Alchemical Crossbow's description, once the first shot has been fired, you have only one minute to fire the remaining shots or they are wasted.

You can use the <b>Unload Alchemical Crossbow</b> macro to unload the bomb from your Alchemical Crossbow. If you haven't fired the crossbow since loading the bomb, you'll get it back in your inventory, but if you've used at least one use, the remaining uses will be wasted.

### Alchemical Shot
You can use the <b>Alchemical Shot</b> macro to pour an alchemical bomb into a firearm or crossbow. This will give your weapon the <b>Alchemical Shot</b> effect, changing its damage type, and adding persistent damage to its damage rolls. It will also add a roll note to the weapon's attack rolls in case of a failure, informing you to take damage. The effect will be removed upon the end of your turn or firing another shot with that weapon.

### Risky Reload
When you post the <b>Risky Reload</b> action to chat, you will be prompted to choose a firearm, as with reloading, but this will also give your weapon the <b>Risky Reload</b> effect. You can then make a Strike. If the Strike fails, the weapon will misfire and gain the <b>Jammed</b> effect. You can clear the jam either by using the <b>Clear Jam</b> macro, clicking the Clear Jam button in the auxiliary actions on your character sheet, or simply removing the effect. The Strike will have a note to remind you that a miss results in a misfire, in case the attack roll had no target to determine the degree of success.

### Advanced Thrown Weapon System
This enhancement to thrown weapons handles the management of which weapons are worn, held, and dropped. A Game Master can enable or disable this system in the module settings <i>(default: disabled)</i>. This feature is currently implemented only for PCs.

With the Advanced Thrown Weapon system, thrown weapons are treated as individual items even if they're part of the same stack. For example, if you have three throwing daggers in a stack which is set as "worn", drawing the weapon will instead create a new stack with one throwing dagger and set that one as held. The other two will remain in the original stack as "worn". This is the same for dropping, sheathing, stowing etc. Empty stacks are then removed.

When you attack with a thrown weapon, the weapon will be added to a "dropped" stack, however the original "held" stack will still be kept, even if it's empty. This is so the damage buttons are still usable, but you won't be able to roll another attack until you've drawn or picked up another one.

### NPC Weapon & Ammunition System
You can use the <b>NPC Weapon Configuration</b> macro with an NPC selected to map their attacks onto weapons and ammunition in their inventory, and enable the Advanced Ammunition and Thrown Weapon Systems for that NPC. Assigning ammunition to an attack will cause the ammunition to be consumed when fired, and enabling the Advanced Ammunition System or Advanced Thrown Weapon System will allow the NPC to take full advantage of the features detailed above.

#### Tip
For NPCs which will have tokens which are <i>not</i> linked to their actor, open their character sheet from the Actors directory and configure their weapons before placing the tokens. The tokens will inherit the configuration from the actor and can then be tweaked as necessary by selecting the token and using the <b>NPC Weapon Configuration</b> macro again.

## Configuration
These are the settings available for the module (all world-scope).

### Post Full Action from Macros (default: enabled)
If enabled, the action represented used by a macro is posted to chat, as well as the summary of what happened. If disabled, the summary is still posted.

### Post Full Ammunition Description (default: disabled)
If enabled, when you fire a weapon while using non-standard ammunition, the ammunition item will be posted to chat instead of the compact "X has used Y" message.

### Prevent Firing Weapon if not Loaded (default: enabled)
If enabled, weapons with a reload entry (or reload trait, for NPCs) cannot be fired unless they're loaded.

### Advanced Ammunition System (Player) (default: disabled)
Enable the Advanced Ammunition System, as described above, for PCs.

### Advanced Thrown Weapon System (Player) (default: enabled)
Enable the Advanced Thrown Weapon System, as described above, for PCs.

### Minimum Permission to See Messages (default: None)
When the module generates a message for an action being performed (e.g. reload, hunt prey etc), the message will only appear for users with at least the permission level set here.
